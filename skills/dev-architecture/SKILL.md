# Dev-Architecture — Module Boundaries & Structural Integrity

> **C0/C1 work (small local patches):** See `dev` §0.0 Work Classifier + §0.1 Patch Fast-Path before reading references.
> **Always read `dev/SKILL.md` first** for project-wide conventions before applying architecture rules.

Enforces architectural rules that prevent structural decay: circular dependencies, implicit coupling, barrel abuse, and misplaced validation. These rules are mechanical — an AI coding agent can follow them without subjective judgment.

Severity mapping (dev §0.2): `Severity: CRITICAL`/`HIGH` ⇒ STRICT; `MEDIUM` ⇒ DEFAULT.

## Modular References

| File | When to Read | What It Covers |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| `references/circular-dependencies.md` | Detecting or fixing import cycles | Detection commands (madge/pydeps/go vet), fix strategies, real examples |
| `references/coupling-taxonomy.md` | Reviewing code for hidden coupling | 8 coupling types, severity matrix, refactoring patterns, banned review responses |
| `references/barrel-discipline.md` | Creating/modifying index/barrel files | When barrels OK vs banned, tree-shaking impact, safe barrel template |

## External/current architecture evidence

Architecture rules in this skill are local and mechanical. When an architectural
decision depends on current framework guidance, cloud/provider reference
architecture, package deprecation, platform limits, or public source evidence,
read the active `search` skill and follow its query-rewrite, source-fetch, and
evidence-status rules. Use browser verification only after candidate URLs exist.

## 1. Module Boundaries

### Layered Architecture Boundaries

| Layer | May Import | MUST NOT Import | Example |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Presentation (UI/CLI/Controller) | Application, Domain | Infrastructure directly | React component importing DB client |
| Application (Use Cases/Services) | Domain, Ports | Presentation, Infra adapters | Service importing React component |
| Domain (Entities/Value Objects) | Nothing (self-contained) | Any other layer | Entity importing Express |
| Infrastructure (Adapters/DB/HTTP) | Domain (implements ports) | Presentation, Application | DB adapter importing controller |

### When to Split a Module

Canonical file-size rule: **>400 LOC -> split (DEFAULT)**. Deviations require a stated reason.

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| File exceeds 400 LOC | Split by responsibility (DEFAULT) |
| Module has 6+ direct dependents | Extract shared interface |
| Two unrelated features share a file | Separate into own modules |
| Circular import detected | Extract shared types/interfaces to a third module |
| Module name contains "and" or "utils" | Split by actual concern |
| 3+ apps/services import the same feature folder | Promote to a monorepo package with its own manifest + public boundary |
| Package needs its own release cadence, CI matrix, or version | Split at package level, not folder level |

### Banned Patterns

| Banned | Why | Fix |
|--------|-----|-----|
| `utils.ts` / `helpers.ts` growing unbounded | Becomes a coupling magnet | Split by domain: `date-utils.ts`, `string-format.ts` |
| Cross-layer direct import | Breaks dependency direction | Use ports/adapters or event bus |
| Shared mutable state between modules | Hidden temporal coupling | Pass explicitly or use event system |
| God module (20+ exports) | Everything depends on it | Extract cohesive sub-modules |

### Module SSOT (Single Source of Truth)

Every concept, constant, type, or configuration value MUST have exactly one canonical owner module.

| Concept | Canonical Owner | Consumers Do |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Shared types / interfaces | `types/` or `contracts/` module | Import, never redefine |
| Constants / magic values | Domain-specific constants module | Import the constant |
| Config / env | Central config module | Import resolved values |
| Validation schemas | Boundary module (API entry) | Import schema, don't recreate |
| API contracts | API layer | Import types from API module |

| Banned | Why | Fix |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Duplicating a type/constant in a consumer | Two sources of truth → drift | Import from canonical owner |
| "Local copy for convenience" | Convenience becomes divergence | Import the original |
| Re-deriving a value that has a canonical source | Silent inconsistency | Import the derived value or computation |

### Deep Modules and Seams

Use this vocabulary when deciding whether an abstraction earns its keep:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Module | A cohesive unit with a named responsibility and public interface |
| Interface | The small surface consumers depend on |
| Implementation | The hidden work behind that surface |
| Depth | Large useful behavior hidden behind a small interface |
| Seam | A boundary where alternative implementations are real or likely |
| Adapter | Code translating one external shape into the module's interface |
| Leverage | How much change the abstraction absorbs for its callers |
| Locality | How close related behavior stays to its owning concept |

Frontend depth means small props/events hiding complex rendering, state management,
data transformation, or integration behavior. One adapter usually means hypothetical
indirection; two adapters, or a near-term second adapter, is evidence of a real seam.
Do not expose internals only for tests; test through the public interface or add a
boundary-owned diagnostic hook with production value.

## 2. Circular Dependency Detection & Prevention

**Severity: CRITICAL**
**Rule:** No circular dependency may exist between modules. Every detected cycle MUST be resolved before merge.

### Required Agent Workflow

| Phase | Required Action | Pass Condition |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1. Detect | Run ecosystem-specific detection command | Command exits clean (no cycles reported) |
| 2. Classify | Identify cycle type: direct A<->B or transitive A->B->C->A | Type documented |
| 3. Analyze | Determine root cause: shared type? callback? event? | Root interface identified |
| 4. Fix | Apply appropriate fix strategy (see references/) | Detection command passes |
| 5. Verify | Re-run detection + confirm no regressions | Zero cycles in report |

Detection commands are ecosystem-specific. See `references/circular-dependencies.md`
for command templates, examples, and verification details.

### Banned Patterns

| Banned Pattern | Why Banned | Required Fix |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| A imports B, B imports A (direct cycle) | Compile failures, bundler issues, test fragility | Extract shared interface to C |
| Type-only cycle (`import type` both ways) | Still signals wrong boundary | Move shared types to `types/` module |
| Barrel re-export creating hidden cycle | Index file masks real dependency graph | Remove barrel, use direct imports |
| Lazy import to "break" cycle (`require()` inside function) | Hides the problem, breaks tree-shaking | Fix the architecture, not the symptom |
| "It works in runtime" as justification | Fragile, bundler-dependent, blocks refactoring | Must pass static analysis |
| Circular via test file importing source that imports test helper | Test infra leaking into production graph | Isolate test helpers in `__test_utils__/` |

### Fix Guidance

| Situation | Preferred Fix |
|-----------|---------------|
| Two modules share types | Extract `types.ts` or `contracts/` module both import |
| Module A calls back into B | Dependency inversion: A defines interface, B implements |
| Event producer and consumer import each other | Event bus / mediator pattern |
| Circular at package level (monorepo) | Introduce `shared` or `contracts` package |
| UI component imports its container | Lift shared state to context or prop drilling |
| Service layer cycle | Extract orchestrator service or use events |

---

## 3. Implicit Coupling Taxonomy

**Severity: CRITICAL**
**Rule:** Every coupling instance in a code review MUST be classified by type. Coupling severity determines whether the code can merge.

### Coupling Types (ordered by severity, worst first)

| # | Type | Definition | Severity | Fix Pattern |
|---|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Content** | Module reaches into another's internals | CRITICAL | Expose via public API/method |
| 2 | **Common** | Multiple modules share global mutable state | CRITICAL | Dependency injection, immutable config |
| 3 | **Control** | Module passes flag to control another's logic | HIGH | Polymorphism, strategy pattern |
| 4 | **Stamp** | Module passes large struct when only one field needed | HIGH | Pass only needed fields |
| 5 | **External** | Multiple modules depend on same external format | HIGH | Single parser module, shared schema |
| 6 | **Temporal** | Modules must execute in specific order | MEDIUM | Make ordering explicit (state machine, builder) |
| 7 | **Sequential** | Output of A is input of B | LOW | Document the contract, validate at boundary |
| 8 | **Functional** | Modules share a well-defined interface | LOW | This is GOOD coupling — the target state |

See `references/coupling-taxonomy.md` for examples, detection signals,
refactoring patterns, and banned review responses.

### Review Decision Matrix

| Severity | Merge? | Action Required |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| CRITICAL (Content, Common) | BLOCK | Must refactor before merge |
| HIGH (Control, Stamp, External) | BLOCK unless justified | Require tech-debt ticket if merged |
| MEDIUM (Temporal) | Allowed with documentation | Add ordering comments or state assertions |
| LOW (Sequential, Functional) | ALLOWED | No action needed |

## 4. Boundary-Only Defensive Programming

**Severity: CRITICAL**
**Rule:** Validation and defensive checks belong ONLY at system boundaries. Internal module boundaries MUST trust their callers.

Ownership split: **placement** (validation happens at the boundary, nowhere else) is owned
by this section; **what the validation schema enforces** (content/policy) is owned by
`dev-security` §1.

### Validation Location Matrix

| Location | Validate? | Rationale | Example |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| HTTP/API controller input | YES | Untrusted external data | Zod schema, JSON schema |
| CLI argument parsing | YES | Untrusted user input | yargs/commander validation |
| File system reads | YES | External data, may be corrupt | Parse + validate structure |
| Database query results | YES at ORM-untyped/raw-query boundaries (shape only); NO when a typed schema/ORM guarantees the shape | Untyped results may drift; typed guarantees are trusted (see Banned Patterns) | Check raw-query nulls/shape; trust typed ORM results |
| Message queue consumer | YES | Cross-process boundary | Validate message schema |
| **Internal function params** | **NO** | Caller is trusted code you control | Type system handles this |
| **Private method args** | **NO** | Same module, same author | Redundant — types suffice |
| **Service-to-service in same process** | **NO** | In-process calls share type system | Interface contracts handle this |

### Banned Patterns

| Banned Pattern | Why Banned | Fix |
|----------------|-----------|-----|
| `if (!param) throw` at start of every internal function | Redundant with type system, clutters code | Remove — let TypeScript/types enforce |
| Runtime type checks in typed language internals | Duplicates compiler work, adds noise | Trust the type system |
| `assert(x !== null)` in module-internal code | If x can be null, fix the type; if it can't, the assert is noise | Fix type signature or remove assert |
| Validation in domain entity constructor for in-process callers | Entities should be created from validated data | Validate at boundary, trust domain layer |
| Try-catch around every internal call | Hides bugs, makes debugging harder | Let errors propagate, catch at boundary |
| Null checks after DB query that schema guarantees NOT NULL | Distrusts your own schema | Trust schema, validate at migration time |

### Allowed Defensive Checks (Exceptions)

| Situation | Why Allowed | Pattern |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Security-critical path (auth, crypto) | Defense in depth required by policy | Double-check even internal calls |
| Data from deserialization (JSON.parse) | Runtime data, types lost | Validate with schema (Zod/io-ts) |
| Plugin/extension boundary | Third-party code, untrusted | Validate at plugin interface |
| Across deployment boundary (microservice call) | Network = system boundary | Full validation required |
| Feature flags / A-B test paths | Runtime variation, not type-safe | Guard with runtime check |

### Fix Guidance

| Smell | Diagnosis | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| 10+ `if (!x) throw` in one file | Over-defensive internal code | Remove guards, fix types |
| Every function starts with parameter validation | Boundary confusion | Move all validation to entry point |
| `try { } catch { return null }` everywhere | Error suppression | Let errors bubble, handle at boundary |
| `typeof x === 'string'` in TypeScript | Distrusting compiler | Remove, or fix the type to be accurate |
| Same validation in controller AND service | Duplicated boundary | Validate once at controller, service trusts |

---

## 5. Barrel/Re-export Discipline

**Severity: HIGH**
**Rule:** Barrel files (index.ts/index.js/__init__.py) are ONLY allowed at public boundaries — package APIs and feature public boundary exports. Internal convenience barrels are banned.

### Barrel Policy Matrix

| Context | Barrel Allowed? | Rationale |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Library/package public API (`packages/ui/index.ts`) | YES | Single entry point for consumers |
| Framework plugin entry (`plugin/index.ts`) | YES | Plugin contract requires it |
| Feature public boundary export (`features/auth/index.ts` as the feature's single external entry) | YES | Public Boundary Export (dev-scaffolding §1); external consumers import the boundary |
| Feature internal convenience barrel (re-exporting siblings for imports inside the feature) | NO | Hides internal structure, breaks tree-shaking |
| Utility folder (`utils/index.ts`) | NO | Creates coupling magnet |
| Component folder re-exporting siblings | NO | Direct imports are clearer |
| Monorepo package boundary (`@org/shared/index.ts`) | YES | Cross-package contract |

See `references/barrel-discipline.md` for import examples, tree-shaking
details, ESLint enforcement, and the safe barrel template.

## 6. Review Integration

### Architecture Review Checklist (for code-reviewer)

When reviewing any PR that adds/modifies module structure, verify:

- [ ] **No new circular dependencies** — run `madge --circular` or equivalent
- [ ] **Layer violations** — no upward imports (infra->domain OK, domain->infra BLOCKED)
- [ ] **Coupling classified** — any new cross-module dependency has coupling type identified
- [ ] **No CRITICAL/HIGH coupling without justification** — Content/Common/Control coupling blocked
- [ ] **Barrel files** — no new internal barrels; existing public barrels use named exports only
- [ ] **Validation placement** — new validation is at system boundary, not internal functions
- [ ] **Module size** — new/modified modules under 400 LOC
- [ ] **No "utils" growth** — shared code placed in domain-specific module, not catch-all utils
- [ ] **Dependency direction** — dependencies point inward toward Domain: outer layers depend on inner layers (Presentation/Application/Infrastructure -> Domain), and inner layers never import outward
- [ ] **No lazy-import hacks** — no `require()` inside function body to hide circular deps

### Automated Enforcement (CI Recommendations)

| Check | Tool | CI Command |
|-------|------|------------|
| Layer/dependency rules (preferred CI gate) | dependency-cruiser | `npx depcruise --validate .dependency-cruiser.cjs src/` |
| Import boundaries | eslint-plugin-boundaries | ESLint with boundaries config |
| Circular deps (quick visualization) | madge | `npx madge --circular --extensions ts,tsx src/ && echo "OK"` |
| Barrel abuse | Biome `noBarrelFile` or ESLint `no-restricted-imports` | pattern for internal index files |
| Dead files/exports/deps | knip | `npx knip` |
| Monorepo package consistency | sherif | `npx sherif` |
| Module size | custom script | `find src -name '*.ts' -exec wc -l {} + \| awk '$1 > 400'` |

## Cross-Skill References

- **Observability**: Trace emission at module boundaries is a production/long-lived-runtime concern (DEFAULT there, not universal). See `dev-backend/references/core/observability.md` for the canonical OTel setup.
- **Security**: Validate at every trust/process/external boundary (HTTP entry, IPC, file/CLI input, third-party responses). Intra-trust-domain module calls follow §4 boundary-only defense — do not re-validate already-trusted data. See `dev-security/SKILL.md` for input validation and auth patterns.

## Quick Decision Trees

### "Should I create a new module?"

```
Does the code serve a distinct responsibility? 
  NO  -> Keep in existing module
  YES -> Is it used by 3+ other modules?
    NO  -> Co-locate with primary consumer
    YES -> Create dedicated module with clear interface
```

### "Is this coupling acceptable?"

```
What type? (see taxonomy above)
  Content/Common -> BLOCK, refactor now
  Control/Stamp/External -> BLOCK unless tech-debt ticket created
  Temporal -> ALLOW with documentation
  Sequential/Functional -> ALLOW
```

### "Where does this validation go?"

```
Is the data source external (HTTP, file, queue, DB, user input)?
  YES -> Validate here (boundary)
  NO  -> Is this a security-critical path?
    YES -> Validate (defense in depth)
    NO  -> Trust the type system, no validation needed
```

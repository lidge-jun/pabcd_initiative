## §1 The Two Halves of Branch Deletion

GitHub's repository setting `delete_branch_on_merge` covers exactly one case:
the head branch of a **merged** pull request. It does nothing for a pull request
closed without merging, and nothing for a branch that never had a pull request.

```bash
# What the host already handles
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO --jq .delete_branch_on_merge   # true => merged heads auto-delete
```

| Branch origin | Handled by `delete_branch_on_merge` | Needs automation |
|---|---|---|
| Head of a merged PR | Yes | No |
| Head of a PR closed unmerged | **No** | Yes — scheduled job |
| Never had a PR | No | No — human judgment, not automation |

The third row is deliberate. A branch with no pull request has no recorded
terminal decision, so no rule can infer that its work was abandoned. Automating
it deletes work that was merely parked.

> **Verified case:** a delivery repository had `delete_branch_on_merge` enabled and still
> accumulated 59 deletable remote branches. Enabling the setting and calling
> branch hygiene done is the single most common version of this mistake.

## §2 Deletion Plan — Keep Rules

Every keep rule below exists because the opposite behavior destroys work that is
still referenced. Apply them as an ordered filter over candidate branches.

| # | Keep when | Because |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Branch is protected (`main`, `dev`, `preview`, `gh-pages`, or host-marked protected) | Integration and release lines are never candidates |
| 2 | **Any** PR that ever used it as a head is merged | Reopening a PR whose head branch is gone cannot restore commits |
| 3 | **Any** PR that ever used it as a head is open | Deleting an open PR's head closes the PR |
| 4 | It is the **base** of an open PR | Deleting a stack parent closes the open child |
| 5 | Any related PR is cross-repository (fork) | The ref lives in the contributor's repository |
| 6 | `closed_at` is missing on a related closed PR | Cannot compute eligibility; fail closed |
| 7 | Newest `closed_at` is inside the grace period | Leaves room to reopen a mistaken close |
| 8 | No PR ever used it as a head | No recorded terminal decision; out of automation scope |

Rules 2 and 3 quantify over **every** PR that used the branch as a head, not the
most recent one. A branch reused across several PRs is common, and one merged or
open PR anywhere in that set is enough to keep it.

Rule 5 compares repository **ids**:

```js
// Correct: a fork commonly reuses upstream branch names
const isCrossRepository =
  !pr.head || !pr.head.repo || pr.head.repo.id !== pr.base.repo.id;

// Wrong: name comparison silently misclassifies same-name forks
// const isCrossRepository = pr.head.label.startsWith(owner) === false;
```

Re-check host branch protection at delete time, not only at plan time. The plan
is a snapshot; protection is authoritative.

## §3 Scheduled Automation Shape

A closed-PR cleanup job is a scheduled workflow with a narrow token, and its
trigger surface is a security boundary.

| Property | Setting | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | `schedule` only | A branch-selected `workflow_dispatch` would run *that branch's* body with `contents: write`, bypassing default-branch review |
| Workflow `permissions` | `{}` | Grant at job level only |
| Job `permissions` | `contents: write`, `pull-requests: read` | Delete refs; read PR state the keep rules need |
| Third-party actions | Full commit SHA pins + version comment | Mutable refs are a supply-chain hole |
| Planning logic | Pure module, unit-tested | Keep rules must be testable without Actions or a live repository |
| Delete errors | Treat 404/422 as "already gone" | The ref can move between plan and delete |

> **Scheduled workflows run only from the repository default branch.** Landing
> the workflow on an integration branch like `dev` does not start it. It begins
> running when the change is promoted to the default branch — say so explicitly
> in the PR, or the job's silence reads as a defect.

Extract the deletion plan as a pure function so the keep rules can be tested
directly. Each rule in §2 deserves a test whose failure means real work is
destroyed: merged head, open head, stacked base, fork head, grace period,
missing timestamp, protected branch.

## §4 Manual Cleanup Procedure

For a one-time cleanup of an already-degraded repository, work in this order.
Order matters: worktrees hold branches, and a held branch cannot be deleted.

**1. Snapshot first (`DEVOPS-BRANCH-SNAPSHOT-01`).**

```bash
CLEANUP_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"   # or a gitignored .tmp/ path in the worktree
git for-each-ref --format='%(objectname) %(refname)' refs/heads refs/remotes \
  > "$CLEANUP_DIR/refs-snapshot.txt"
git worktree list --porcelain > "$CLEANUP_DIR/worktrees-snapshot.txt"
gh pr list --state all --limit 1000 \
  --json number,state,headRefName,baseRefName,mergedAt,closedAt,isCrossRepository \
  > "$CLEANUP_DIR/prs.json"
```

Restoring a deleted remote branch needs only its SHA:

```bash
git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/<name>
```

**2. Classify every ref against live PR state**, not against name patterns.
Join branches to PRs by head ref, then apply §2. `git branch -r --merged` alone
is insufficient: squash-merge rewrites commits, so a squash-merged branch is not
an ancestor of the target and reads as unmerged.

**3. Audit worktrees before removing them (`DEVOPS-WORKTREE-DIRTY-01`).**

```bash
git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{print $2}' | while read -r wt; do
  n="$(git -C "$wt" status --porcelain --untracked-files=no 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
  [ "$n" != "0" ] && echo "DIRTY $n $wt"
done
```

A detached-HEAD worktree needs its own check: if its commit is reachable from no
branch and sits ahead of the integration line, it holds unique work.

```bash
git branch -a --contains <sha>            # empty => referenced by no branch
git rev-list --count origin/dev..<sha>    # >0 => carries commits dev does not
```

**4. Delete in order:** worktrees, then remote branches, then local branches.

```bash
git worktree remove --force <path>          # only after the dirty audit
git push --no-verify origin ':branch-a' ':branch-b'
git branch -D branch-a branch-b
```

`--no-verify` is often required because a pre-push hook that assumes a pushed
ref will reject a delete refspec. `git branch -D` (not `-d`) is correct for a
squash-merged branch, since `-d` demands ancestry the squash destroyed — but
only after §2 supplied independent evidence.

**5. Set `fetch.prune`** so future upstream deletions clean local tracking refs:

```bash
git config fetch.prune true
```

Note that `git remote prune <fork>` removes only *local tracking* refs for
branches already deleted upstream. It does not, and must not, touch the fork.

## §5 Anti-Patterns

| Banned | Why | Fix |
|--------|-----|-----|
| `delete_branch_on_merge` alone, called done | Closed-unmerged PRs still accumulate forever | Add the scheduled closed-PR job (§3) |
| Bulk-prune by name pattern | Patterns do not encode PR state, stacks, or forks | Per-branch evidence (§2) |
| `git branch -r --merged` as sole merge proof | Squash-merge breaks ancestry; merged branches read unmerged | Join to live PR state |
| Deleting a closed stack parent | Closes the open child PR | Keep any base of an open PR |
| `git worktree remove --force` before a dirty check | Discards uncommitted work irrecoverably | Audit every worktree first |
| Deleting refs with no snapshot | Remote deletions are unrecoverable without the SHA | `for-each-ref` snapshot first |
| `workflow_dispatch` on a `contents: write` cleanup job | Runs a chosen branch's body with write scope | Schedule-only trigger |
| Fork branch matching by name | Same-name forks get misclassified as local | Compare repo ids |

## §6 Source

Measured branch and worktree cleanup, 2026-08-26. The repository carried 101
remote branches, 228 local branches, and 67 worktrees; 59 remote, 177 local, and
59 worktrees were removed against per-branch evidence, with open PRs, protected
lines, dirty worktrees, and one unreferenced detached commit preserved.

The automation gap in §1 was found during that cleanup and closed by
`.github/workflows/cleanup-closed-pr-branches.yml` with the plan extracted to
`.github/scripts/closed-pr-branch-cleanup.cjs` (lidge-jun/opencodex#2664,
merged as `bae100aa7`).

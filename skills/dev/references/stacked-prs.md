# Stacked Pull Requests (canonical — `DEV-STACK-*`)

Canonical owner: `dev`. Other skills carry pointer stubs only. Rules here are
tool-agnostic: the portable model first, CLI recipes second.

## The model

A **stack** is an ordered chain of branches. The **bottom** branch is based on
trunk (usually `main`); every branch above is based on the branch below it. Each
branch gets its own PR whose base is the branch below, so each PR's diff shows
only that layer.

```
feature/ui        → PR #3 (base: feature/api)     ← top
feature/api       → PR #2 (base: feature/schema)
feature/schema    → PR #1 (base: main)            ← bottom
──────────────────  main (trunk)
```

Four invariants hold across every stacking tool (GitHub `gh stack`, Graphite, Git
Town, plain git). Learn these, not a vendor's flags:

1. **The base ref is the dependency edge.** The chain is your phase map, made
   reviewable.
2. **Editing a lower layer invalidates every layer above it** — always cascade.
3. **Merging is bottom-up.** Out-of-order merges are the pathological case.
4. **Every layer must stand alone for review**: own thesis, own build, own tests.

## DEV-STACK-01 — When to stack (DEFAULT)

Stack when **all** of these hold:

- the work splits into 2+ parts with a real dependency order (later parts consume
  earlier parts' output), and
- shipping it as one PR would produce a diff too large to review in one sitting —
  by your repository's own review-size convention if it has one, otherwise
  reviewer judgment, and
- the lower parts are mergeable on their own — they do not need the upper parts to
  be correct or safe.

PABCD produces stack-shaped work by construction: a `dev-pabcd` PHASE-SPLIT-01
phase map is dependency-ordered (foundations → core → integration → hardening)
and each phase must close with something independently verifiable. That map **is**
a stack plan; a LOOP-UNIT-CHAIN-01 chain of work-phases under one objective is
the same shape across cycles.

Do **not** stack when:

- the change is one cohesive thesis (splitting adds review and CI surface, buys
  nothing);
- the parts are independent — open parallel PRs off trunk instead, since a stack
  imposes a false merge order;
- the lower layer is speculative and likely to be rewritten (every rewrite
  re-cascades);
- you cannot name what each layer proves on its own (that is a slicing failure —
  fix the slice before opening anything).

**Depth (HEURISTIC — practitioner guidance, not a measured limit).** Aim for 2–4
layers and think hard at 5. Community practice guides suggest each layer be
reviewable in roughly 10–15 minutes and report stacks becoming unwieldy past about
4–5 layers; treat that as experience, not a rule. What is certain: every layer is
a separate fully gated PR with its own review and its own CI, and every layer
above an edit has to be re-stacked by hand or by tool. If the map is longer, ship
the bottom half, land it, then stack the rest.

**Slice by dependency, never by effort.** "Quick wins first" produces layers whose
dependency runs opposite to the merge order, so the stack cannot land bottom-up.
This is `dev-pabcd` PHASE-SPLIT-01 applied to branches.

## DEV-STACK-02 — Cascading edits (STRICT)

When a lower layer changes, every layer above it is based on a commit that no
longer exists. Re-push the cascade before asking for review:

- Plain git (no extension): `git rebase --update-refs` force-updates any branch
  pointing at a commit inside the rebased range. Branches checked out in another
  worktree are not updated. Enable by default with
  `git config --global rebase.updateRefs true`; disable per-invocation with
  `--no-update-refs`.
- `gh stack rebase` fetches origin and cascades from trunk upward; if a layer's PR
  has already merged it switches to `--onto` mode automatically. Conflicts pause
  the run; resume with `--continue`, unwind everything with `--abort`. Scope with
  `--downstack` / `--upstack` / `--no-trunk`.
- Other tools (Graphite `gt restack` / `gt modify`, Git Town `git town sync`,
  `spr diff`) express the same cascade — read their own docs before using their
  flags.

After the cascade, publish with `git push --force-with-lease` (never bare
`--force`) and re-check each PR's base ref. A rebase rewrites the reviewed
commits, so depending on repository settings a force-push can invalidate existing
review state and leave inline comments attached to commits that no longer exist.
Assume review state is stale after a cascade: say what changed and re-request
review rather than expecting prior approvals to carry.

**Verification (STRICT):** a cascade is not done because the command exited 0.
Confirm each upper branch actually contains the new lower-layer commit
(`git log --oneline <lower>..<upper>` shows only that layer's commits) and that
each PR's base ref still names the branch below it.

## DEV-STACK-03 — Layer shape (DEFAULT)

Each layer:

- has one thesis, stated in its PR title;
- builds and passes its own tests at its own tip — do not defer a layer's tests
  upward;
- carries a stack map in its PR body so reviewers can navigate:

```markdown
**Stack** (merge bottom-up):
| # | PR | Layer | Review focus |
|---|----|-------|--------------|
| 3 | #103 | UI | integration only |
| 2 | #102 | API | endpoint behavior |
| 1 | #101 | schema ← you are here | migration + rollback |

Depends on #101. Review this PR's diff only.
```

Mid-stack layers are **not** lightly gated: on GitHub, branch protection such as
CODEOWNERS approval is enforced on every PR in the stack — including mid-stack PRs
that do not target the default branch — and CI configured for the default branch
runs for all of them, not just the bottom. Budget for that: a 5-layer stack is 5
fully gated PRs, not one.

## DEV-STACK-05 — Reviewing a layer (DEFAULT)

When you are reviewing one layer of a stack:

- **Review this layer's diff only.** Its base is the branch below, so the diff is
  already scoped to the layer. Do not re-litigate a lower layer's decisions here —
  comment on that layer's own PR.
- **Judge the layer standalone** (`DEV-STACK-03`). Does it build and pass its tests
  at its own tip? "Tests come in the next PR" is a blocking finding, not a
  courtesy.
- **Verify the base ref.** A layer whose base points at trunk instead of its
  parent, or whose branch lacks the parent's latest commits, is a stale cascade
  (`DEV-STACK-02`) — block until it is re-stacked.
- **Re-check your findings after a force-push.** A cascade rewrites commits, so
  confirm earlier findings and approvals survived rather than assuming they
  carried.
- **Approving a layer is not approval to merge the stack.** Merge order and
  authorization stay with `DEV-STACK-04`.

## DEV-STACK-04 — Merging and safety (ESCALATE)

- **Merge bottom-up.** On GitHub, merging the top PR brings every PR below it;
  merging a mid-stack PR merges everything below it while the PRs above stay open
  and re-target the stack's base automatically.
- **Merging stays user-authorized.** `DEV-GIT-PUSH-01` already gates pushing;
  merging a stack is a strictly larger external state change. Never merge, never
  enable auto-merge, and never bypass a queue on the agent's own initiative.
- **Never reorder or drop a layer that has already merged** — reconstruct forward
  instead.
- **Squash caution.** Squash merging collapses a PR's commits into one and does not
  preserve the originals. GitHub's own guidance is that squash merging works best
  for short-lived branches: if you keep working on the same head branch
  afterwards, later PRs can include commits already squashed into the base, making
  conflicts more likely and forcing you to resolve the same conflict more than
  once. In a stack, cascade immediately after any squash merge.
- **Required reviews interact with shared commits.** Under required reviews,
  collaborators cannot merge a PR while other open PRs have a head branch pointing
  at the same commit with pending or rejected reviews — a shape stacks produce
  easily. Resolve those first.
- Merge requirements for every PR in a GitHub stack are determined by the
  **bottom** PR's base branch.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it bites |
|---|---|
| Deep stacks (practitioner guidance: past ~4–5 layers) | Every added layer is another gated PR to review and another branch to re-stack on each cascade; practitioners report navigation cost outweighing the benefit past that range (experience, not a measured limit — see Depth above) |
| Effort-bucketed layers ("quick wins first") | Produces layers whose dependency runs opposite to the merge order, so the stack cannot land bottom-up |
| Mid-stack rewrites without a cascade | Upper branches keep a base that no longer exists; the PR diff shows unrelated commits |
| Force-push without `--force-with-lease` | Overwrites collaborator work, and may invalidate existing review state |
| Assuming mid-stack PRs are lightly gated | CODEOWNERS and default-branch CI apply to every layer |
| Merging the top PR expecting only that layer | It brings every PR below it |
| Stacking a single cohesive change | Every layer is a separately gated PR with its own review and CI, for no parallelism gain |

## Tooling

You do not need an extension: `gh pr create --base <branch-below>` expresses the
chain and `git rebase --update-refs` maintains it. Pass `--base` explicitly for
every layer: when it is omitted, `gh` uses the `branch.<current>.gh-merge-base`
config and, if that is unset, the repository's default branch — so a layer can
silently target trunk instead of its parent.

GitHub's first-party extension is `gh stack`
(`gh extension install github/gh-stack`, requires `gh` v2.0+). Core verbs:
`init`, `add`, `push`, `view`, `submit`, `rebase`, `modify`; `up`/`down` navigate
(up = away from trunk). Stack metadata lives in `.git/gh-stack` (JSON,
uncommitted) and it enables `git rerere` on init so conflict resolutions replay
across cascades. It also ships an agent-facing skill:
`gh skill install github/gh-stack`.

GitHub's native stacked-PR feature was in **public preview** as of 2026-08-03 —
verify current status before relying on preview-only behavior.

Sources for the behavioral claims above, all opened 2026-08-03: `git rebase` docs
(`--update-refs`), GitHub Docs "About stacked pull requests", "Pull request
merges", and "About protected branches", the `gh pr create` manual, and the
`github/gh-stack` README. Claim-by-claim provenance is recorded in the codexclaw
devlog unit for stacked pull requests (2026-08-03).

# UI/UX Design: Intent Discovery, Patterns & Product Vocabulary

Activates by change surface when:
- User's design direction is vague ("깔끔하게", "모던하게", "just make it look good")
- Building onboarding, empty state, error state, or loading state UI
- User references a product aesthetic ("Notion 느낌", "Linear처럼")
- Starting a new design system or generating a color palette
- Choosing layout patterns or navigation architecture
- Setting up favicons, product logos, or brand identity elements
- Handling logo dark mode variants, OG images, or social sharing meta

Read this before style-specific references when the user cannot articulate a clear design direction.
For anti-slop detection and banned patterns, defer to `dev-frontend/references/core/anti-slop.md`.

**Emoji ban (stub):** no emoji as UI visual elements (STRICT). Canonical rule, scope, and exemptions: `dev-frontend` §5 / `dev-frontend/references/core/anti-slop.md § Emoji Slop`.

**Role separation:** This skill provides design **judgment** (when/why). `dev-frontend` provides **implementation** (CSS/HTML how). When both have a reference on the same topic (e.g., typography, logos), read this skill first for the decision, then dev-frontend for the code.

**External/current design evidence:** For live product-reference claims, current
design-system docs, browser API behavior, accessibility guidance that may have
changed, or browser-rendered source evidence, read the active `search` skill and
follow its query-rewrite, source-fetch, and evidence-status rules. Use browser
fetch/open/text/get-dom/snapshot only after candidate URLs exist.

> **C0/C1 work (small local patches):** See `dev` §0.0 Work Classifier + §0.1 Patch Fast-Path before reading references.

> **`dev` is canonical:** `dev` §0.2 Rule Classes, §3 Verification Gate, and §5 Safety Rules apply to all work governed by this skill.

> **Role boundary (canonical):**
> `dev` owns universal process, evidence, and safety rules. `dev-uiux-design` owns
> design intent, direction, and concept judgment. `dev-frontend` owns concrete frontend
> implementation and rendered tell enforcement. Anti-slop has three layers: `dev` =
> output/process hygiene, `dev-uiux-design` = concept/taste judgment,
> `dev-frontend` = rendered implementation tell detection and removal.

> **Rule class note (UX-STYLE-01):** Everything in this skill that expresses taste —
> product personalities, design-isms, preset tokens, aesthetic vocabulary — is
> `STYLE_SAMPLE`: examples to draw from, never universal requirements. Objective UX
> correctness (state coverage, accessibility, readability) is owned by `dev-frontend`
> §1.5 and stays STRICT/DEFAULT.

## Lazy-User Gate (UX-LAZY-01, DEFAULT — ponytail discipline applied to UX)

Design for the cognitively frugal user: users don't read, they scan; they satisfice;
they will trade choice for one obvious next action. Before shipping any user-facing
decision point — option, setting, step, confirmation, input field, mode — justify its
existence the ponytail way, in order:

1. **Do nothing**: can a correct default remove this decision entirely? (A settings
   page is a collection of defaults you failed to choose.)
2. **Delete**: does the step/field earn its completion-rate cost? Every added decision
   point taxes conversion and comprehension (Hick's law).
3. **Absorb**: can the system take the complexity instead of the user (Tesler's law) —
   auto-detect, infer, remember last choice?
4. **Demote**: still needed for some users → progressive disclosure (advanced section,
   "more options"), never a top-level fork.

Every screen has ONE primary action. If two actions compete visually, the design has
not decided what the screen is for.

**Surface-conditional (do not over-apply):** laziness means *fewer decisions* on
consumer/one-shot flows (D1-D3), but *fewer repeated motions* on repeated-work tools
(D4-D8: density, keyboard paths, batch actions — collapsing an expert's controls into
wizards is the inverse failure). Route by the product-density profile first.

**STRICT exemptions (never one-click away):** destructive/irreversible actions,
consent/privacy/legal choices, payments confirmation, and accessibility affordances
are never collapsed into magic defaults.

## UX State Contract (UX-STATE-01)

For onboarding, empty, loading, error, or progressive-disclosure work, answer the state meaning before styling. Deep patterns live in `references/ux-states.md`.

- Onboarding teaches the first meaningful action, not the whole product.
- Empty explains why the state exists and names the next action.
- Loading chooses skeleton for known structure, spinner/progress for short unknown waits, and avoids fake completion.
- Error exposes retry, recovery, or escalation; never dead-end the user.
- Progressive disclosure names what stays hidden, why, and where it becomes available.

## IA Chooser (UX-IA-01)

Default navigation architecture by work shape; read `references/responsive-nav.md` for responsive details.

| Work shape | Default IA |
|------------|------------|
| Dense desktop repeated work | Sidebar + command palette |
| Medium sectioned work | Tabs or segmented navigation |
| Mobile-primary consumer flow | Bottom nav, sheet, or thumb-zone actions |
| Wizard/auth/setup | Stepper or stacked linear flow |

## 1. User Intent Discovery Protocol

When the user's design request is vague ("깔끔하게 해줘", "모던하게", "just make it look good"), do not produce generic output. Run the compact ambiguity flow (UX-INTENT-01):
1. Produce the Design Read from §2 using available signals.
2. If one decision still blocks the direction, ask ONE best clarifying fork with binary/ternary choices.
3. Proceed from the answer; if the user does not answer and the task can continue, choose the most domain-correct default and state the assumption. On EXPRESSIVE surfaces (landing/consumer/creative/AI-product), that default is the No-Brief Default Direction below (UX-DEFAULT-ISM-01); quiet surfaces keep quiet domain-correct defaults.

> Skip this section if the user provided explicit design specs or this is a ≤5-line patch.

### No-Brief Default Direction (UX-DEFAULT-ISM-01, DEFAULT — kit content STYLE_SAMPLE)

This is the UX-INTENT-01 step-3 FALLBACK, never a bypass: it fires only after
the Design Read and after the one blocking fork is resolved or unanswered, and
the applied direction is ALWAYS stated as an explicit assumption in the
deliverable. A named, specific, domain-gated direction replaces generic LLM
defaults; it must NOT reintroduce generic glassmorphism / centered-card /
beige-default taste under a new label.

Default kit for expressive surfaces: **Liquid Editorial** (2026 composite,
decided 2026-07-07 from Tier-2 trend research — see `references/design-isms.md`
§1.13 for the full signature):

- Structure: type-led editorial composition (oversized authored headline
  scale, grotesk default, serif display only with editorial rationale per
  UX-TYPE-01), tactile/photographic texture over flat gradient washes,
  asymmetric content-weighted layout.
- Material accent: Liquid Glass or near-opaque pill chrome ONLY on floating
  functional layers (nav/toolbars/chip clusters); pill-chip content units;
  content layer stays solid (`dev-frontend` FE-LIQUID-LAYER-01).
- Motion: feedback baseline + exactly ONE signature moment
  (pointer-proximity chips or scroll-driven reveal), per motion domain gates.
- Color: OKLCH-derived single accent + tinted neutrals (hue budget,
  `references/color-system.md`).

Domain gate (STRICT): dashboards, admin, ops, finance, gov, B2B repeated-work
tools NEVER receive this kit by default — "fancy" never overrides domain
correctness (§ IA Chooser + `dev-frontend` product-density profiles).

**Optional deepening:** use the ladder below only when the first fork fails or the user explicitly wants guided exploration.
- Use binary/ternary choices, not open-ended questions.
- Reference known products — users recognize what they want faster than they articulate it.
- If the diagram skill is available, offer: "참고로 스타일 비교를 다이어그램으로 보여드릴 수도 있어요."
- If the user names a specific product reference, skip remaining steps and map directly via `references/product-personalities.md`.

### Step 1 — Mood

Ask: "전체적인 분위기가 어떤 느낌이면 좋을까요?" / "What overall feeling should the product have?"

| Option | Signals | Product References |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| 전문적/신뢰감 (Professional) | swiss, flat, restrained | Linear, Vercel, GitHub |
| 따뜻한/친근한 (Warm/Friendly) | rounded, warm-neutrals, illustrations | Notion, Airbnb, Toss |
| 고급스러운/세련된 (Premium) | generous-whitespace, thin-type, restrained-color | Apple, Stripe, Aesop |
| 재미있는/활기찬 (Fun/Energetic) | bright-colors, playful-shapes, bold-type | Figma, Discord |
| 대담한/독특한 (Bold/Distinctive) | brutalism, asymmetry, experimental | Gumroad, Nothing |

### Step 2 — Lightness

Ask: "밝은 화면이 좋으신가요, 어두운 화면이 좋으신가요?" / "Light or dark background?"

| Option | CSS |
|--------|-----|
| 밝은 배경 (Light) | `bg-white text-gray-900` |
| 어두운 배경 (Dark) | `bg-gray-950 text-gray-100` |
| 둘 다 (Both / auto) | `prefers-color-scheme` aware |

### Step 3 — Density

Ask: "화면에 정보가 많이 보이는 게 좋으신가요, 여유롭게 보이는 게 좋으신가요?" / "Dense or spacious?"

| Option | VISUAL_DENSITY | Tokens |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| 빽빽하게 (Dense) | 8–10 | `text-sm py-1 px-2 gap-1` |
| 보통 (Normal) | 4–7 | `text-base py-3 px-4 gap-4` |
| 여유롭게 (Spacious) | 1–3 | `text-lg py-8 px-8 gap-8` |

### Step 4 — Shape

Ask: "모서리가 각진 느낌이 좋으신가요, 둥근 느낌이 좋으신가요?" / "Sharp or rounded?"

| Option | CSS | Signals |
|--------|-----|---------|
| 각진 (Sharp) | `rounded-none` / 0–2px | Vercel, brutalism, swiss |
| 살짝 둥근 (Slightly rounded) | `rounded-md` / 6–8px | Linear, Notion, material |
| 많이 둥근 (Very rounded) | `rounded-2xl` / 16–24px | Figma, iOS, Toss |

### Step 5 — Viewport Priority

Ask: "주로 어떤 화면에서 볼 건가요?" / "What's the primary viewing device?"

| Option | Responsive Strategy | Key Constraint |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 데스크탑 위주 (Desktop-first) | Desktop layout → tablet → mobile collapse | Data density OK, hover interactions OK |
| 모바일 위주 (Mobile-first) | Mobile layout → tablet → desktop expansion | Thumb zone, touch targets, minimal density |
| 둘 다 중요 (Both equally) | Design mobile AND desktop as separate compositions, not one adapted from the other | Most work — section order/composition may differ |

Cross-ref: `references/responsive-nav.md` for canonical breakpoints and container query patterns, `dev-frontend/references/core/mobile-ux.md` for mobile-specific composition rules.

### Step 6 — Reference

Ask: "혹시 '이런 느낌이면 좋겠다' 하는 사이트나 앱이 있으신가요?" / "Any website or app that feels like what you want?"

This single question often resolves all ambiguity. If the user names a product, map it via `references/product-personalities.md`.

### Vague Request Disambiguation

When the user gives feedback without specifics, translate:

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "더 좋게" / "make it better" | Ask: "레이아웃? 색상? 타이포? 여백?" — identify the dimension |
| "더 전문적으로" / "more professional" | Increase whitespace, reduce color count to 2–3, tighten grid alignment |
| "더 모던하게" / "more modern" | Negative letter-spacing on headings, offer dark mode, reduce radius to 8px |
| "더 재미있게" / "more exciting" | Add one bold accent color, increase type contrast, add micro-animation on hover |
| "너무 심심해" / "too boring" | Add asymmetric layout, introduce one unexpected element, vary section rhythm |
| "너무 복잡해" / "too busy" | Reduce element count, increase whitespace, limit to 2 colors |

---

## 2. Design Read (MANDATORY for new pages, components, or layouts. Optional for ≤5-line patches — see dev §0.1 Patch Fast-Path.)

Before generating ANY frontend code, produce a Design Read. If the project has a `DESIGN.md` file, read it first — its tokens and prose override everything below.

### Output format (mini DESIGN.md)

Filled-in example: `references/design-read-example.md`.

```yaml
---
name: <project-name>
colors:
  primary: "<hex>"
  accent: "<hex>"
  background: "<hex>"
typography:
  heading: { fontFamily: <font>, fontSize: <size> }
  body: { fontFamily: <font>, fontSize: <size> }
---
```

Reading this as: <page kind> for <audience>, with a <vibe> language.
<1-2 sentences: specific reference, not adjectives. "1970s lecture handout" > "modern and clean">

Do's: <context-specific positive from brief>
Don'ts: <context-specific ban from brief>

### Signals to read
1. Page kind — landing (SaaS/consumer/agency/event), portfolio, redesign, editorial, app UI, tool UI
2. Vibe words — what the user said or implied
3. Reference signals — URLs, screenshots, brands named
4. Audience — B2B procurement vs design-conscious consumer vs recruiter
5. Existing brand assets — logo, color, type, photography
6. Quiet constraints — accessibility-first, public-sector, regulated, kids

### Dial Setting (MANDATORY — immediately after Design Read)

From the Design Read, derive and declare three dials before any code:

```
DESIGN_VARIANCE: <1-10>
MOTION_INTENSITY: <1-10>
Product density profile: <D1-D8> (see dev-frontend/references/core/product-density.md)
Reasoning: <one sentence explaining why these values match the brief>
```

Inference rules:
- Corporate/gov/utility → VARIANCE 2-4, MOTION 1-3, density D2-D3
- Marketing/landing → VARIANCE 4-7, MOTION 3-5, density D2-D3
- Creative/portfolio/editorial → VARIANCE 6-9, MOTION 4-7, density D1-D3
- Dashboard/SaaS/admin → VARIANCE 2-4, MOTION 1-2, density D4-D5
- "Complex" in brief → increase density profile (functional depth), NOT VARIANCE or MOTION
- "Simple" in brief → decrease all three proportionally

"복잡하다" = high DESIGN_VARIANCE is WRONG. Complexity means more features/data/flows, not more visual tricks (carousels, parallax, animations).

### Anti-Default Discipline
Do not default to: warm beige backgrounds, centered hero, three equal feature cards, generic glassmorphism, Inter + slate-900, card-based everything. These are LLM defaults. Reach past them BASED ON the design read.

If the brief is ambiguous, ask ONE clarifying question. Not a multi-question dump.

### DESIGN.md persistence
If the project needs persistent design tokens across sessions, save the Design Read as a full `DESIGN.md` in the project root. Format spec: `references/design-system-bootstrap.md § DESIGN.md Format`.

---

## 3. Korean Request Translation

Map common Korean design descriptors to concrete tokens. When the user uses these words, translate before implementing.

| Korean | Literal | CSS/Token Translation |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| 깔끔하게 | cleanly | Generous whitespace (24-48px gaps), strict grid, max 2-3 colors, saturation < 60%, 1px borders or none, 4-8px radius, single font, no/subtle shadows |
| 모던하게 | modern | Geometric sans-serif (Geist/Outfit), negative letter-spacing on headings, dark mode or high-contrast light, 8-16px radius, spring micro-interactions |
| 고급스럽게 | luxurious | Very generous whitespace (48-96px padding), thin weights (300-400), serif for headings, low-saturation palette, slow animations (800ms+), 0-4px radius |
| 심플하게 | simply | Max 3-4 element types per screen, 1-2 colors, single font, 2-3 size steps, hidden/minimal navigation, zero decoration |
| 트렌디하게 | trendy | Glassmorphism, bento grid, gradient mesh, variable fonts — ask for a reference site |
| 따뜻하게 | warmly | Warm hue range (stone/amber/orange), 12-20px radius, warm-tinted shadows rgba(180,140,100,0.1), serif or rounded sans |
| 차가운 | cold/cool | Cool grays (slate/zinc), blue-tinted whites, geometric sans, thin weights, 0-8px radius |
| 감성적으로 | emotionally | Editorial/lifestyle, serif display + sans body, muted/pastel colors, generous line-height, photography-heavy |

**Clarifying questions per term:**
- 깔끔: "Notion처럼 따뜻한 깔끔함인지, Vercel처럼 차가운 깔끔함인지요?"
- 모던: "다크 모드 + 날카로움(Linear)인지, 화이트 + 미니멀(Vercel)인지요?"
- 고급: "브랜드 고급감(Apple/Stripe)인지, 패션 럭셔리(Art Deco)인지요?"
- 심플: "기능이 적은 건지, 기능은 많지만 화면이 심플해 보이길 원하는 건지요?"

---

## 4. Quick-Match Table

Rapid lookup: user word → concrete starting point.

| User (KO) | User (EN) | Start From | Dark? | Radius | Density | Font |
|------------|-----------|------------|-------|--------|---------|------|
| 깔끔하게 | Clean | Notion or Vercel | No | 8px | 4–7 | Geist / Pretendard |
| 모던하게 | Modern | Linear or Vercel | Yes | 6px | 4–7 | Geist / Outfit |
| 고급스럽게 | Premium | Apple or Stripe | Either | 0–4px | 1–3 | Satoshi / system thin-300 |
| 심플하게 | Simple | Vercel | Either | 0px | 1–3 | Geist |
| 따뜻하게 | Warm | Notion or Toss | No | 12px | 4–7 | Pretendard / Cabinet Grotesk |
| 재미있게 | Fun | Figma | No | 16px+ | 4–7 | Custom grotesque |
| 전문적으로 | Professional | Linear or GitHub | Either | 6px | 4–7 | Geist / Outfit |
| 대담하게 | Bold | Neobrutalism | No | 0px | 4–7 | Black 900 |
| 감성적으로 | Aesthetic | Editorial | No | 0–4px | 1–3 | Serif display |
| 트렌디하게 | Trendy | Ask for reference | Either | 12px | 4–7 | Variable font |

### Font Selection Guidelines (STYLE_SAMPLE)

- **Typography stance (UX-TYPE-01)**: sans by default; serif only with brief/brand/editorial rationale. When justified (AI-product/editorial/research/trust surfaces), use the three-role system — display serif at light weights 330-400 + sans UI + mono accent — never serif-everywhere or as a bare AI-premium shortcut ("tasteslop", 2026); gates in `dev-frontend` `aesthetics.md § Serif Discipline`.

- **Primary default**: Geist (modern SaaS, Vercel ecosystem)
- **Korean-first**: Pretendard — strong Korean-first default (Pretendard Variable
  available); verify brand/product font rules before claiming any specific Korean
  company standard
- **Warm/editorial**: Outfit or Cabinet Grotesk
- **Premium/luxury**: Satoshi or system thin weights
- **Korean serif display**: MaruBuri (Naver 명조/부리) 400-600 for editorial Hangul headlines, paired with Pretendard UI — see `dev-frontend` `korea-2026.md § Korean Serif / Myeongjo Display`
- **Avoid defaulting to Inter** (DEFAULT) — a widely recognized AI-generated-UI tell
  (judgment rule, not a measured fact). Use it when the user requests it or the project
  already uses it.
